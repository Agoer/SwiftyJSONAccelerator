Formats and generates models for the given JSON and also breaks them into files making it easy to manage and share between several models. it relies on [SwiftyJSON](https://github.com/SwiftyJSON/SwiftyJSON) and requires you to include it in your project.\r\n\r\nCurrently, the pattern is very similar to its Objective-C counterpart. It generates classes with following properties.\r\n\r\n- Initalize with `JSON` (SwiftyJSON based)\r\n- Initalize with `AnyObject`\r\n- `NSCoding` compliant (Can be Archived using `NSKeyedArchiver`)\r\n- Convert to `NSDictionary`\r\n\t \r\n![Preview](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/insanoid/SwiftyJSONAccelerator/master/preview.png)\r\n\r\n*Simple configurable interface for generation of file*\r\n\r\n\r\n![Preview](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/insanoid/SwiftyJSONAccelerator/master/preview_ii.png)\r\n\r\n*Files are generated individually making it more easy to use.*\r\n\r\n## TODO\r\n\r\n- Handle blank array a bit better.\r\n- Better User Interface and icon.\r\n- Generate both `struct` and `class`.\r\n- Support for generation of models that do not need SwiftyJSON.\r\n- Add tests and integrate with Travis CI.\r\n- Create a Xcode plugin and a command line executor.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThis is one of my very first Swift projects, since I am used to developing models from JSON based APIs in Objective-C and there was no free tool to do this in Swift I created this (with ample inspiration from [SwiftJSON](https://github.com/swiftjson/SwiftJson) and[JSONAccelerator](http://nerdery.com/json-accelerator)). Any suggestions regarding code quality of the app, generated code's quaility, swift improvements and pull requests are all higly welcome.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
